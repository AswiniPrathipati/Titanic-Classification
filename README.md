# Titanic-Classification

This project focuses on predicting the survival status of passengers aboard the Titanic. The analysis uses the "titanic.csv" dataset, which includes information about passengers such as age, gender, class, and survival status. The goal is to build a classification model that predicts whether a passenger survived or not based on the provided features.
